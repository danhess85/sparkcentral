				<p>
					Media Temple has garnered more than 125,000 customers throughout 100 countries, 
					powering more than 1.5 million websites. They were also recently named #330 on 
					Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500, an honor coveted by every tech company in North America.
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition to stand-out products (including domain registration, virtual servers, 
					web hosting and other cloud services) (mt) also boasts an unprecedented dedication 
					to customer service, providing 24/7 support via 6 channels including email, live chat, 
					phone, and of course, the most savvy and swift of all, Social Media. 
				</p>

				<p>
					MediaTemple has a few primary social agents, with total of 20 people who can cover 
					the feed at any given time. With Sparkcentral at the helm, (mt) handles about 4,000 messages 
					on Twitter per month or about 130 per day.
				</p>

				<h3>Media Temple’s Current Social Strategy </h3>
				<p>“We provide support over our Twitter feed 24/7/365 and we aim to have Twitter responses 
					within minutes, rather than hours or days.  Whether someone has a question, comment, or 
					even just wants to chat about something "off topic," we will always engage. 
				</p>

				<h3>Tailored Twitter Service</h3>
				<p>“While I don't think that a 24/7 presence is necessary for everyone, (mt) is an ‘always 
					on’ company. We have customers all over the world, and many of them run their businesses 
					on our services. This means it's extremely important for us to be available to all of our 
					customers, all the time. We've had 24/7 phone support for several years and so naturally our 
					Twitter support, and eventually chat support, followed.”
				</p>

				<h3>Human Interest</h3>
				<p>“Our primary focus is in humanizing our company with our interactions. Many times, emotion 
					and the ‘people’ aspect of social media can get lost behind text, logos and computer/mobile 
					displays. We do our best to make sure our community knows who they are talking to, while also 
					remaining helpful and professional.”
				</p>
				<p>
					With Sparkcentral at its Side MediaTemple Prepares for Exponential Growth
				</p>

				<h3>Why Twitter?</h3>
				<p>“Twitter as a support medium is an extremely cost efficient channel. In our case, the cost is 
					much less compared to our traditional channels such as phone and email. Using Twitter is also 
					a great opportunity to showcase a company’s support and attentiveness to customers, as well 
					as an embracing of the times. Public displays of great support is good and inexpensive marketing.
				</p>

				<h3>Public Discourse</h3>
				<p>“It's inevitable that people are going to complain. Whether you provide the platform or not, 
					people will post their feelings somewhere. It's really important to address feedback, or at 
					the very least *listen* to it. Every complaint is an opportunity to learn something. Even if 
					it turns out that the origin of the problem was not in your company's control, there is still
					the potential to educate a customer.”
				</p>

				<h3>Sparkcentral to the Rescue</h3>
				<p>When Sara first approached Sparkcentral about bolstering her social customer service software, 
					(mt) was using SocialEngage (previously CoTweet) by ExactTarget. While Sara insists that in 
					many ways, SocialEngage was a good product, the instability proved to be a detrimental deal-breaker.
				</p>

				<h3>Of Twitter and Trust</h3>
				<p>“CoTweet would be unavailable for hours on end more times than we could afford and the lack 
					of support from ExactTarget is ultimately what drove us to look for other options. Frequently, 
					CoTweet would go down, and our service would take a very long time to come back online and back 
					up to speed. This was particularly crippling for a crucial and active support channel.”
				</p>

				<h3>Crisis Management</h3>
				<p>While we have somewhere around 20 agents trained on providing Twitter support, and there are 
					usually 1-2 agents actively covering our Twitter feed at any given time, when there’s a crisis 
					it's all hands on deck! If there is an incident that prompts several tweets to us in a short 
					period of time, we usually have about 5 or so agents on Twitter to handle the incoming messages.
				</p>
				<p>
					We provide incident status updates, and we also do our best to respond to everyone individually.
					We utilize some saved messaging to repeat to customers, but not everyone. We feel it's important 
					that our customers understand they're talking to humans and not an autoresponder.
				</p>

				<h3>Features Worth Fighting For</h3>
				<p>Sparkcentral enables us to keep our workflow and communication smooth with features like persistent
					in-client chat, conversation comments, and account notes.”
				</p>

				<p>

						friendship – they always make themselves available.
