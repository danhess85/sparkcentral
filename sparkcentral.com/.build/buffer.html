				<h1>The Secret of Buffer's Knock-Your-Socks-Off Social Customer Service</h1>

				<p>
					Founded just over two years ago, Buffer is a social media start-up that 
					enables its users to share their posts automatically throughout the day, 
					whether it’s pictures and video, or articles and blogs.
				</p>

				<p>
					Joel Gascoigne first launched Buffer in the U.K., but has since expanded exponentially, 
					bringing on board two co-founders – Leo Widrich and Tom Moor – as well as 6 additional 
					team members, 2 of which are dedicated solely to customer service. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Currently, Buffer boasts more than 450,000 users and makes about $1 million in 
					yearly revenue. While Buffer is devoted to the ongoing development of an “amazing 
					product,” Gascoigne stresses that Buffer is just as dedicated to customer service. 
					In fact, their social customer service agents are called ‘Happiness Heroes’.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Having amazing customer service is the one area we’ve wanted so badly to be good at,” 
					says Gascoigne. “It’s one of our core values. We tried so many different products – 
					we even thought about building our own platform because it was that important.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Luckily for Gascoigne, he discovered Sparkcentral instead. Sparkcentral is one of the best things we’ve found.”
				</p>


				<h3>24/7 Customer Service. To Do or Not To Do? That is the Question.</h3>
				<p>Currently, Buffer is “working its way” towards 24/7 customer service. In 
					the “early days,” Joel, Tom and Leo were able to divide and conquer, answering 
					every one of their customers’ quandaries – both on email and Twitter – personally. 
					But as their user numbers grew – fast – they realized they needed some help. Fast.
				</p>

				<p>
					“We wanted to provide the same quality and speed but we had too much [volume] 
					for just us.” These days Buffer has two full-time support agents, one in London 
					and one in Nashville, “but anyone on the team can jump in to reply.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					Together, they cover quite a number of time zones. 
				</p>

				<p>“We want to be known for fantastic support.”</p>


				<h3>Twitter Love and Loyalty By The Numbers</h3>
				<p>
					Buffer receives about 2 - 300 tweets a day. 50%  
					are answered within 0-20 minutes and 90% within 6 hours. 
				</p>

				<p>
					“We’ve found that there’s a real benefit if you get in your response quickly and in a useful way, like...actually solve people’s problems.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Gascoigne says that when people reach out via email and receive an answer 5-10 
					minutes later, they’re, “amazed, and become quite loyal. They’re also quite likely 
					to tweet about the experience. These are the things we are starting to quantify, 
					compare people who’ve had touchpoint with support and compare that with those who don’t.”
				</p>

				<p>The Buffer team treats their Twitter feed like a hungry inbox that’s always 
					looking for more information. “We try to get [questions] down to 0 and keep monitoring it, even when its empty.” 
				</p>

				<h3>Let’s Talk Transparency</h3>

				<p>
					While many companies believe that social media is a risky channel for angry 
					customers to stir the (public) pot of criticism, Buffer feels differently.
				</p>

				<p>
					“I don’t think you have a choice about it really, people are already talking about you,” says Gascoigne. 
				</p>

				<p>
					At Sparkcentral, we believe that making mistakes is a chance to fulfill your promise 
					that you won’t let your customers down. And Buffer agrees.
				</p>

				<p>
					“There are so many examples of people saying something negative but as 
					long as we make good on the goals we’ve set and get back to them straight 
					away...we find that 90% of the time we can turn it around and actually be in a better position than when it started.”

				</p>
				<p>
					Buffer even publishes a monthly roundup of just how happy their customers were with the aptly named, Happiness Report:
				</p>

				<p>In December on Twitter, Buffer responded to nearly 5,000 mentions and added around 3,500 new followers. 
				</p>

				<h3>Crisis Management</h3>
				<p>“What if,” if a dangerous game to play, but it can also be a life-saver. 
					If you anticipate what might go wrong, you won’t be left shivering in the social wind, alone.
				</p>

				<p>
					“If something happens – like a server goes down – people get really annoyed at first. But soon enough, everything turns around.” 
				</p>

				<p>
					Keep communication lines free and flowing, provide a sincere apology, and your loyal customers will stick by your side.
				</p>

				<p>
					“They’ll even Tweet publicly, ‘Buffer guys are working hard.’ It begins to have a community feel.”
				</p>

				<h3>Social Customer Service – What’s In It For Me? Value.
				</h3>

				<p>Gascoigne says disbelievers pop up all the time, tweeting ‘why would I use Buffer?’ and negative things like that.  
				</p>

				<p>
					“We’re very personal about [our tweets.] They have our first names and our customers know we’re human beings. When people tweet about us, all these customers who’ve had a good experience with Buffer will jump in and defend us. And that’s powerful.”
				</p>
