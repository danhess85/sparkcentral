					It's 2014, and NEWSFLASH: customers are demanding service at practically the speed of light. Whether it's waiting for a barista 
					to craft a coffee, or tweeting a about weather delays, customers expect "freaky fast" service. 
					If you're like most people, you're rarely in the mood to call customer service while at the airport. With Sparkcentral, the 
					Brussels Airlines social team embraces and even pioneers the current speedy demands of customers by quickly responding to 
					their busy travelers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Kim Daenen is Brussels Airlines Social Media Manager. "Most of our customers are on the go so they are using a mobile device 
					when they reach out," says Kim. "Our goals are to help our passengers quickly and efficiently, and to manage the company’s 
					reputation. We are responding much faster now because we have a better overview of all incoming questions."
					Have you ever ordered lunch at the counter, and then been told that you’re only allowed to order at the drive-thru window? 
					We hope not, because that would be ridiculous. The same goes for customer service. The days of companies setting expectations 
					and calling the shots are gone. The customer tells you when, where, and how they need to talk to you - and you need to be 
					there and ready to help. 
				</p>

				<p>
					With airlines leading the charge in social customer service, Brussels Airlines aims to stay on top of their game and the 
					competition. “We try to attend as many social customer service and social enterprise forums (both inside and outside the 
					aviation industry) as possible. I think sometimes the most refreshing ideas come from outside your own industry.”
					The way a crisis is handled over social media can make or break brands. When Brussels Airlines pilots went on strike, 
					thousands of airline passengers were affected. Not only was the Brussels Airlines social team able to comfortably handle 
					the influx of social mentions, but they even managed to garner compliments from their customers.
					“We noticed a big change in the efficiency and speed of replying to customers,” says Kim. "We weren’t the only ones to 
					notice, as we received a lot of positive comments from passengers via social media.” Upset customers actually praising 
					you during a crisis? Now that’s awesome.
				</p>

				<p>
					Kim boasts that Sparkcentral's ease of use is one of her team's favorite aspects of using the tool. "We used a basic monitoring tool before, but weren’t able to follow up very efficiently regarding which customers had been taken care of 
					and which still required an answer. We chose Sparkcentral because we wanted the most straightforward tool out there. The 
					simplicity of the tool is very important to us, as we want to get more and more people on social customer service internally.”
				</p>

				<em><h3>
					Why did you chose Sparkcentral? Is this your first social customer support tool?
				</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong> This is our first social customer support tool.  We used a basic monitoring tool 
					before, but weren't able to follow up very efficiently. Like which customers had been taken care of and which still 
					required an answer. We chose Sparkcentral because we wanted the most straightforward tool out there. The simplicity 
					of the tool was very important to us, as we want to get more and more people on board internally, working on the 
					social media servicing, also on an ad hoc basis when needed. For example, when crisis communication is needed, 
					the Manager On Duty should be able to use the tool without much explanation.
				</p>


				<em><h3>Have you noticed any trends with your response times since using Sparkcentral?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong> We didn't measure our response times before because we didn't have 
					the tools for it, but I know that we are responding much faster now just because we have a better 
					overview of all incoming questions. We also get a lot of positive feedback from our followers and 
					our community that we’re doing a good job.
				</p>

				<em><h3>Do you have a plan in place to encourage more people to direct questions to you over social media?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>
					Once we will have a team ready and trained, our plan is to advertise the social media service in all 
					customer touch points. The aim is not so much to push the customer towards social media per se, but to 
					put the customer in control, so that they get to choose how they want to communicate with us.
				</p>

				<em><h3>Do you notice that most people are on mobile phones and not in front of a desktop when they reach out to you?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong> Yes, definitely on Twitter. Most of our customers are on the go so they are using a mobile 
					device when they reach out. On Facebook, we notice the biggest part of the questions are customer relations 
					related, so these people reach out after they've traveled and mostly from a desktop. 
				</p>

				<em><h3>What are the most typical questions people ask over social?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>Miles &amp; More questions (our frequent flier program),
					questions about luggage allowance, and special equipment (music instruments or sports equipment) are very common as well.
					Operational questions about their flights.
				</p>

				<em><h3>How big is your team size? How did you go about creating your team? Was it from social media experts, or customer success experts?</h3></em>

				<p><strong>Kim:</strong>We are currently two people working on Social Media Servicing. The team was formed very 
					naturally, because one of us was working in the External Communications Department, the other in the Web Department,
					and we both had a deep knowledge of, and interest in social media. We started our social media channels very low key, 
					until they grew into a real customer service channel after the ash cloud in 2010. The aim is to bring the 
					social customer service to the Service Center in 2014.
				</p>

				<em><h3>How did your team manage the recent strike, which canceled many flights? Did you have many customers reaching out over social media?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong> We had many customers reaching out to us on Twitter and Facebook during the two day strike looking 
					for information. It was our first crisis communication practice with SparkCentral since we began using the tool. We 
					noticed a big change in the efficiency and speed of replying to customers and connecting them to the right information 
					on the website thanks to the snippet feature in Sparkcentral. We weren't the only ones to notice, as we received 
					a lot of positive comments from passengers via social media.
				</p>

				<em><h3>What is your favorite part of Sparkcentral?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>The simplicity is definitely the best part of Sparkcentral. Your conversations are pushed 
					to you and you see the overview of all previous interactions with that passenger (which is necessary to avoid 
					embarrassing answer). Done? You just archive. What I love most is that when you have gone through all 
					questions and requests, you get a nice “well done” ;) Gives a very satisfying feeling.
				</p>

				<em><h3>Do more people tweet vs. call/email? Has social media changed or influenced your call or email volume?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>The majority of our passengers still call or e-mail the Service Center. 
					The “regulars” who know our social media channels well, come directly to us.
				</p>

				<em><h3>What are your team goals? How is success managed on your team?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>Our goals are to help our passengers quickly (we aim to answer questions within 1 hour) and efficiently 
					(we try to avoid as much as possible to redirect passengers to another channel. Instead we help them right here on 
					Twitter of Facebook) and to manage the company’s reputation.
					Success is measured by monitoring reply times. Every month the social media reports are implemented in our 
					overall customer experience dashboards.
				</p>

				<em><h3>Who makes the purchasing decisions within your company? seniority? department?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>Purchasing decisions are made on VP level.
				</p>

				<em><h3>Do you guys go to any events or read specific outlets to learn more about your industry?</h3></em>

				<p>
					<strong>Kim:</strong>We try to attend as many social customer service and social enterprise forums as possible, inside and 
					outside the aviation industry, because I think sometimes the most refreshing ideas come from outside your own industry.
